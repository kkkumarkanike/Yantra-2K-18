	<div class="col-sm-6">
	<p style="color:white;font-size: 17px;">The students are organizing various technical, cultural, painting competitions, film shows, industries visits, Guest lectures and seminars. The department took academic membership from NAFEMS (International Association for Engineering and Analysis Community), United Kingdom in May 2009 to strengthen the department in area of engineering analysis.  </p><br>	
	<p style="color:white;font-size: 17px;">The department has also established “Mechanical Engineering Students Association (MESA)” which acts as platform to conduct various academic and extra-curricular activities for the benefit of the student family. </p>
	<br>
	<p style="color:white;font-size: 17px;">The Department maintains a department library with collection of 700 textbooks and 80 CD’s with video lectures related to Mechanical Engineering. It has good collection of proceedings on various national and international conferences. The department regularly arranges Industrial tours for the students in each semester to develop the industry-institute interaction. Students excel themselves in extra-curricular and curricular activities also. </p>

Students are encouraged to participate in paper presentations, paper publications and delivering lectures at national and international level. The staff encourages the students to participate in technical and cultural competitions. With the team spirit of staff and students, a national level student technical symposium “YANTRA” in the year 2008 and planned to conduct such event every year. It is intended to create a brand image for YANTRA in coming years by the department. </p>

<center><h1 style="color:white;"> YANTRA 2K-18</h1></center><br>
<div class="container">
<p style="color:white;font-size: 17px;">The pioneer of Technology –the Mechanical Engineer’s endeavour proved again through YANTRA.” MAN MADE BY MECHANISM. WORLD RULED BY MECHANICALS” is the tag line of the YANTRA. And similarly, can you imagine life from ancient man to modern man without the involvement of Mechanical Engineer? Of course not. To this ancient art of engineering many significant changes took place. To know the latest technologies developments, it is necessary to build a platform for exchange of knowledge. One such platform is symposium. YANTRA is one such symposium inviting all building engineers to share their knowledge and explore the possibilities of understanding the contemporary technical advancements. </p>
